        "term": "Exoplanet",
        "definition": "A planet that orbits a star outside our Solar System. These distant worlds vary widely in size, composition, and conditions, offering clues about the diversity of planets in the universe."
    },
    {
        "term": "Host Star",
        "definition": "The main star that a planet orbits. It provides light, heat, and gravitational stability to its planetary system."
    },
    {
        "term": "Number of Stars",
        "definition": "The count of stars in a planetary system. While most systems have one star, some contain two (binary) or more stars orbiting together."

    {
        "term": "Discovery Method",
        "definition": "The technique scientists use to detect exoplanets. Common methods include the Transit Method (watching a planet pass in front of a star) and the Radial Velocity Method (detecting tiny wobbles in a star's movement)."
    },
    {
        "term": "Discovery Facility",
        "definition": "The telescope, satellite, or observatory that was used to discover the exoplanet or star system, such as NASA’s Kepler or the Gaia observatory."

    {
        "term": "Orbital Period",
        "definition": "The time it takes for a planet to complete one full orbit around its host star, usually measured in Earth days or years."
    },
    {
        "term": "Semi-Major Axis",
        "definition": "The average distance between a planet and its star, representing half the longest diameter of the orbit. It's commonly measured in Astronomical Units (AU), where 1 AU is the distance between Earth and the Sun."
    },
    {
        "term": "Mass",
        "definition": "The amount of matter contained in an object, such as a planet or star. It is often compared to Earth’s mass for planets or the Sun’s mass for stars."
    },
    {
        "term": "Orbital Eccentricity",
        "definition": "A measure of how stretched an orbit is. An eccentricity of 0 means a perfect circle, while values closer to 1 mean the orbit is more elongated or oval-shaped."
    },
    {
        "term": "Spectral Type",
        "definition": "A classification system for stars based on their temperature and color, ranging from hot, blue stars to cooler, red stars. It gives insight into the star's energy, age, and composition."
    },
    {
        "term": "Stellar Temperature",
        "definition": "The surface temperature of a star, measured in Kelvin (K). It determines the star's color—hotter stars appear blue, cooler stars appear red."
    },
    {
        "term": "Stellar Radius",
        "definition": "The size of a star, usually compared to the Sun’s radius. Larger stars are generally more luminous but may have shorter lifespans."
    },
    {
        "term": "Stellar Mass",
        "definition": "The total mass of a star, typically measured in Solar masses (compared to the Sun). A star’s mass affects its brightness, lifespan, and ability to form planets."
    },
    {
        "term": "Stellar Metallicity",
        "definition": "The proportion of elements in a star that are heavier than hydrogen and helium. Higher metallicity often means a greater chance of forming planets, especially rocky ones."
    },
    {
        "term": "Gaia Magnitude",
        "definition": "A measure of a star’s brightness as observed by the Gaia space observatory. Lower values indicate brighter stars, while higher values mean dimmer stars."
